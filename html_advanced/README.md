## Overview
This project provides a foundational understanding of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), enabling you to create structured and visually appealing web pages. It guides you through HTML concepts and demonstrates how to translate a wireframe into a functioning HTML document.

---

## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages. It uses tags and elements to define the structure of a document, making it readable and accessible to browsers.

## How to Create an HTML Page from a Wireframe
1. **Analyze the Wireframe**: Break the wireframe into sections (header, footer, sidebar, etc.).  
2. **Plan Your Structure**: Map sections to HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.).  
3. **Write the HTML**:
   - Use semantic tags to maintain clarity and accessibility.
   - Structure the layout using `<div>` or modern CSS Grid/Flexbox methods.
4. **Validate Your HTML**: Use a validation tool like the W3C Validator to ensure correct syntax.

## What is a Markup Language?
A markup language uses annotations or tags to define the structure and formatting of a document. It allows machines (like browsers) to interpret and display content consistently.

---

## What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of nodes. Each node corresponds to an element, allowing scripts (e.g., JavaScript) to interact with the document dynamically.

---

## HTML Elements and Tags
- **Element**: The building block of HTML, defined by opening and closing tags (e.g., `<p>Hello</p>`).  
- **Tag**: Keywords enclosed in angle brackets that mark the beginning and end of an element. Example: `<h1>`.  
  - **Opening Tag**: Starts an element (e.g., `<div>`).  
  - **Closing Tag**: Ends an element (e.g., `</div>`).  

---

## HTML Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements, modifying their behavior or appearance.  
- Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`  
  - `src` specifies the image source.  
  - `alt` provides alternate text for accessibility.

## Purpose of Common HTML Tags
| Tag         | Purpose                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `<html>`    | Defines the root of an HTML document.    |
| `<head>`    | Contains metadata and links to resources.|
| `<title>`   | Specifies the page title.               |
| `<body>`    | Contains the visible content.           |
| `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` | Define headings (from largest to smallest). |
| `<p>`       | Represents a paragraph.                 |
| `<a>`       | Creates hyperlinks.                     |
| `<img>`     | Embeds images.                          |
| `<ul>`/`<ol>` | Create unordered/ordered lists.        |
| `<div>`     | Groups content for styling/layout.      |
