## 📚 Description

In this project, I applied advanced CSS techniques to build a visually accurate webpage based on a Figma design. This task is a continuation of the `HTML, advanced` project and focuses specifically on styling with **pure CSS**—no frameworks, no external libraries.

The design and layout were implemented exactly as defined in the Figma file, covering components like:

- Header and Banner  
- Quotes  
- Videos Section  
- Membership Plan  
- FAQ  
- Footer

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I am now able to:

- ✅ Explain what CSS is and how it works  
- ✅ Style HTML elements with internal, inline, and external styles  
- ✅ Use and understand selectors, classes, and IDs  
- ✅ Calculate and apply **CSS specificity**  
- ✅ Work with the **Box Model** (margin, border, padding, content)  
- ✅ Explain how browsers load and render webpages  
- ✅ Build responsive and visually consistent designs from mockups
